A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects AI assistants to Redmine. It exposes your Redmine instance's projects, issues, time tracking, wiki pages, and files as MCP tools.

> **Fork notice.** This repository ([`meraks/redmine-mcp-server`](https://github.com/meraks/redmine-mcp-server)) started as a fork of [`jztan/redmine-mcp-server`](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server), but it has **diverged from the original repo and is no longer kept in sync with upstream** — it is maintained independently. It trims some optional plugin tools and the MCP Apps UI, and adds a conditional required-fields feature. **It is not published to PyPI or any container registry — install from source or from the Release wheel.** This fork is developed on top of the original repository, and **all licensing and permissions are kept consistent with the original repo** (MIT). See [Differences from upstream](#differences-from-upstream) below.

## [Tool reference](./docs/tool-reference.md) | [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) | [Contributing](./docs/contributing.md) | [Troubleshooting](./docs/troubleshooting.md)

## Features

- **42 core MCP tools** (plus 1 operator tool gated by `REDMINE_MCP_EXPOSE_ADMIN_TOOLS=true`): Issues, projects, time tracking, wiki, Gantt, file operations, membership management, search, and discovery. (The Checklists, CRM/Contacts, DMSF Documents, and Products plugin tools from upstream are **not included** in this fork — see [Differences from upstream](#differences-from-upstream).)
- **Conditional Required Fields**: a `get_required_fields` tool plus a `REDMINE_REQUIRED_FIELDS_FILE` config let you declare required-field rules (varying by tracker/category/status) so issue creation auto-fills defaults and rejects missing required fields before calling Redmine
- **Flexible Authentication**: API key, username/password, or OAuth2 per-user tokens
- **Prompt Injection Protection**: User-controlled content wrapped in boundary tags for safe LLM consumption
- **Read-Only Mode**: Restrict to read-only operations via `REDMINE_MCP_READ_ONLY` environment variable
- **HTTP File Serving**: Secure attachment access via UUID-based URLs with automatic expiry
- **Pagination Support**: Handle large result sets with configurable limits
- **MCP Compliant**: Built on FastMCP with HTTP transport
- **Docker Ready**: Dockerfile, docker-compose setup, and prebuilt images on GHCR

## Differences from upstream

This fork **has diverged from the original repo** ([`jztan/redmine-mcp-server`](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server)) and is maintained independently — it is no longer a drop-in mirror of upstream. The deliberate differences from the original repo are:

- **Added — Conditional Required Fields.** A new `get_required_fields` tool, plus a `REDMINE_REQUIRED_FIELDS_FILE` JSON config, lets you declare required-field rules that vary by tracker / category / status. `create_redmine_issue` auto-fills declared defaults and rejects a still-missing required field with a clear message *before* it ever calls Redmine. This addresses Redmine's stock REST API limitation where `is_required` is only visible on the field definition, not on workflow/role/tracker-imposed rules.
- **Removed — optional plugin tools.** The Checklists (`REDMINE_CHECKLISTS_ENABLED`), Products (`REDMINE_PRODUCTS_ENABLED`), CRM/Contacts (`REDMINE_CRM_ENABLED`), and DMSF Documents (`REDMINE_DMSF_ENABLED`) tools are not built into this fork.
- **Removed — MCP Apps UI.** The interactive Kanban / triage board (`show_triage_board`) and the project dashboard App are not included.
- **Not published to PyPI or GHCR.** This fork is distributed as source and as a prebuilt wheel on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/meraks/redmine-mcp-server/releases) — see [Installation](#installation). Do **not** run `uv tool install redmine-mcp-server`, which would fetch the upstream package, not this fork.

All core tools (issues, projects, time tracking, wiki, files, Gantt, search, discovery), the four authentication modes, read-only mode, pagination, and HTTP file serving are carried over unchanged from upstream.

## Quick Start

1. **Install from source** (this fork is **not** published to PyPI — `uv tool install redmine-mcp-server` installs the upstream package, *not* this fork)
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/meraks/redmine-mcp-server.git
    cd redmine-mcp-server
    uv tool install --from . redmine-mcp-server   # or: pip install .
    ```
2. **Create a `.env` file** with your Redmine credentials
3. **Start the server in stdio mode** (recommended for local clients like Claude Code)
   ```bash
   redmine-mcp-server --stdio
   ```
4. **Add the server to your MCP client** using one of the guides in [MCP Client Configuration](#mcp-client-configuration).

For HTTP mode (remote/Docker/multi-client), run `redmine-mcp-server` without `--stdio`. The server listens on `http://localhost:8000` with the MCP endpoint at `/mcp`, health check at `/health`, and file serving at `/files/{file_id}`.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ (for local installation via `uv tool`)
- Docker (alternative deployment, uses Python 3.13)
- Access to a Redmine instance

#### Redmine Compatibility

The integration suite passes in full against Redmine 6.1 and 7.0. Older
versions are untested. Individual tools list their own minimum where one is
known (global search needs 3.3.0+, issue watchers 2.3.0+, project time-entry
activities 3.4.0+), so on an older server those specific tools fail rather than
the whole server.

OAuth2 is the one hard requirement: it needs Redmine 6.1+ for Doorkeeper
support. See [docs/oauth-setup.md](docs/oauth-setup.md).

### Install from source (this fork is not on PyPI)

This fork is not published to PyPI or any package registry. Build and install it
from the source checkout instead of `uv tool install redmine-mcp-server` (which
would fetch the **upstream** package).

```bash
# Clone this fork
git clone https://github.com/meraks/redmine-mcp-server.git
cd redmine-mcp-server

# Install the tool (editable) via uv
uv tool install --from . redmine-mcp-server
# or, into the current environment:
pip install .

# Create configuration file .env
cat > .env << 'EOF'
# Redmine connection (required)
REDMINE_URL=https://your-redmine-server.com

# Authentication - Use either API key (recommended) or username/password
REDMINE_API_KEY=your_api_key
# OR use username/password:
# REDMINE_USERNAME=your_username
# REDMINE_PASSWORD=your_password

# Server configuration (optional, defaults shown)
SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
SERVER_PORT=8000

# Public URL for file serving (optional)
PUBLIC_HOST=localhost
PUBLIC_PORT=8000

# File management (optional)
ATTACHMENTS_DIR=./attachments
AUTO_CLEANUP_ENABLED=true
CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MINUTES=10
ATTACHMENT_EXPIRES_MINUTES=60
EOF

# Edit .env with your actual Redmine settings
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor

# Run in stdio mode (recommended for local clients like Claude Code)
redmine-mcp-server --stdio
```

### Install from the Release wheel (prebuilt, no PyPI)

Prebuilt wheels are attached to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/meraks/redmine-mcp-server/releases). Download the latest `redmine_mcp_server-*.whl` and install it — this avoids building from source:

```bash
# Install into the current environment
pip install redmine_mcp_server-2.11.0-py3-none-any.whl

# Or install the MCP command globally via uv
uv tool install redmine_mcp_server-2.11.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

The wheel is built from this fork's `develop` branch and is **not** the upstream package. Pick the `.whl` matching the release you want; see the [Releases page](https://github.com/meraks/redmine-mcp-server/releases) for the current version.

### Docker Deployment

This fork does not publish prebuilt images, so build locally from the source checkout:

```bash
docker build -t redmine-mcp-server .
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env.docker redmine-mcp-server
```

See [Docker Deployment](#docker-deployment) for full details.

| `REDMINE_PER_USER_AUDIT_IDENTITY` | No | `false` | `legacy-per-user` only: resolve and log the Redmine user ID per request (adds one extra round-trip) |
| `REDMINE_API_KEY` | Yes† | – | API key (legacy mode only) |
| `REDMINE_USERNAME` | Yes† | – | Username for basic auth (legacy mode only) |
| `REDMINE_PASSWORD` | Yes† | – | Password for basic auth (legacy mode only) |
| `REDMINE_MCP_BASE_URL` | Yes‡ | `http://localhost:3040` | Public base URL of this server, no trailing slash (OAuth modes only) |
| `FASTMCP_STREAMABLE_HTTP_PATH` | No | `/mcp` | MCP transport path inside `REDMINE_MCP_BASE_URL` |
| `REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_ID` | Yes‡ | – | Doorkeeper OAuth client ID used by the MCP server to introspect Bearer tokens (RFC 7662). Register a confidential OAuth app in Redmine (see [`docs/oauth-setup.md`](docs/oauth-setup.md) Step 2). |
| `REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_SECRET` | Yes‡ | – | Secret for the introspection client |
| `REDMINE_MCP_JWT_SIGNING_KEY` | Yes§ | – | Stable signing/encryption key used by FastMCP OAuthProxy tokens and storage |
| `REDMINE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` | No | – | Optional upstream Redmine OAuth client ID for `oauth-proxy`; defaults to `REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_ID` |
| `REDMINE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` | No | – | Optional upstream Redmine OAuth client secret for `oauth-proxy`; defaults to `REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_SECRET` |
| `FASTMCP_HOME` | No | platform default | FastMCP data directory. In `oauth-proxy` mode, encrypted OAuthProxy state is stored below `FASTMCP_HOME/oauth-proxy/` |
| `REDMINE_MCP_ALLOWED_CLIENT_REDIRECT_URIS` | No | loopback only | `oauth-proxy` client redirect-URI allowlist (glob patterns, comma/space separated). Unset = `http://localhost:*` and `http://127.0.0.1:*`; `*` = allow any |
| `HEALTH_INTROSPECTION_TTL_SECONDS` | No | `30` | TTL (seconds) for the `/health` Doorkeeper introspection probe cache. Set to `0` to disable caching. |
| `SERVER_HOST` | No | `0.0.0.0` | Host/IP the MCP server binds to |
| `SERVER_PORT` | No | `8000` | Port the MCP server listens on |
| `PUBLIC_HOST` | No | `localhost` | Hostname used when generating download URLs |
| `PUBLIC_PORT` | No | `8000` | Public port used for download URLs |
| `REDMINE_PUBLIC_URL` | No | – | Publicly-reachable URL of your Redmine instance. When set, `content_url` values returned on attachments are rewritten from `REDMINE_URL`'s origin to this one (preserving path/query/fragment and any reverse-proxy subpath). Useful when `REDMINE_URL` is the internal container hostname unreachable from MCP clients. When unset, the raw URL Redmine echoes back is returned. |
| `ATTACHMENTS_DIR` | No | `./attachments` | Directory for downloaded attachments |
| `ATTACHMENT_MAX_DOWNLOAD_BYTES` | No | `209715200` (200 MB) | Cap applied to every `get_redmine_attachment` download regardless of content type. Exceeding the cap aborts the download mid-stream and deletes the partial file. |
| `REDMINE_MCP_UPLOAD_FILE_ROOTS` | No | – | Extra directories allowed as `file_path` upload sources (OS path separator-separated). `ATTACHMENTS_DIR` is always allowed. Unset restricts uploads to `ATTACHMENTS_DIR` only. |

| `CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MINUTES` | No | `10` | Interval for cleanup task |
| `ATTACHMENT_EXPIRES_MINUTES` | No | `60` | Expiry window for generated download URLs |
| `REDMINE_MCP_EXPOSE_ADMIN_TOOLS` | No | `false` | Expose operator/admin tools on the MCP surface. Currently gates `cleanup_attachment_files`. The background cleanup task runs regardless of this flag. |
| `REDMINE_SSL_VERIFY` | No | `true` | Enable/disable SSL certificate verification |
| `REDMINE_SSL_CERT` | No | – | Path to custom CA certificate file |
| `REDMINE_SSL_CLIENT_CERT` | No | – | Path to client certificate for mutual TLS |
| `REDMINE_TIMEOUT` | No | `30` | Whole seconds to wait for a Redmine HTTP response before failing the call. Applied as a connect timeout of at most 10s plus a read timeout of the full value. Set to `0` to wait indefinitely, which restores the previous behavior and can hang the request. |
| `REDMINE_MCP_READ_ONLY` | No | `false` | Block all write operations (create/update/delete) when set to `true` |
| `REDMINE_OAUTH_SCOPE_ENFORCEMENT` | No | `on` | OAuth modes only: deny tool calls whose access token lacks the tool's Redmine permission scopes, and filter `tools/list` accordingly. Set to `off` temporarily while re-consenting older tokens ([details](docs/oauth-setup.md#scope-enforcement)) |
| `REDMINE_OAUTH_DISCOVERY_AS` | No | `redmine` | OAuth modes only: which authorization server discovery advertises. `redmine` names your Redmine; `self` advertises this server (issuer = `REDMINE_MCP_BASE_URL`) and serves RFC 8414 metadata at its own canonical well-known location, which clients that probe there need, Cursor among them ([details](docs/oauth-setup.md#cursor-and-self-as-discovery)) |
| `REDMINE_MCP_SCOPES` | No | – | OAuth modes only: advertise a subset of scopes in discovery, matching the permissions your Redmine OAuth Application actually enables. Avoids `invalid_scope` at consent when a client requests the full advertised list |
| `REDMINE_AGILE_ENABLED` | No | `false` | Enable RedmineUP Agile plugin support: `get_redmine_issue` returns `story_points`, `agile_sprint_id`, `agile_position`; `update_redmine_issue` accepts `story_points` |
| `REDMINE_CHECKLISTS_ENABLED` | No | `false` | Enable RedmineUP Checklists plugin support: `get_checklist`, `create_checklist_item`, `update_checklist_item` (requires Checklists Pro plugin) |
| `REDMINE_PRODUCTS_ENABLED` | No | `false` | Enable RedmineUP Products plugin support: `manage_product` (action=list/get/create/update) |
| `REDMINE_CRM_ENABLED` | No | `false` | Enable RedmineUP CRM plugin support: `manage_contact` (action=list/get/create/update/delete/assign_to_project/remove_from_project) |
| `REDMINE_DMSF_ENABLED` | No | `false` | Enable DMSF document-management plugin support: `manage_document` (action=list/get/create/update). Requires `redmine_dmsf` plugin on the Redmine server. |
| `REDMINE_TAGS_ENABLED` | No | `false` | Enable AlphaNodes additional_tags plugin support: `get_redmine_issue` returns a `tags` array, and `create_redmine_issue`/`update_redmine_issue` accept a `tag_list`. Requires the `additional_tags` plugin and the `view_issue_tags` / `create_issue_tags` / `edit_issue_tags` permissions on the Redmine server. |
| `REDMINE_AUTOFILL_REQUIRED_CUSTOM_FIELDS` | No | `false` | Enable one retry for issue creation by filling missing required custom fields |
| `REDMINE_REQUIRED_CUSTOM_FIELD_DEFAULTS` | No | `{}` | JSON object mapping required custom field names to fallback values used when creating issues |
| `REDMINE_ALLOW_PRIVATE_FETCH_URLS` | No | `false` | **Warning:** disables all SSRF protection for attachment fetching. Never set to `true` in production. |

*\* Required when `REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=legacy-per-user`.*
*† Required when `REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=legacy`. Either `REDMINE_API_KEY` or `REDMINE_USERNAME`+`REDMINE_PASSWORD` must be set. API key is recommended.*
*‡ Required when `REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=oauth` or `REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=oauth-proxy`.*
*§ Required when `REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=oauth-proxy`.*
Secret values can also be supplied with Docker/Kubernetes-style file variables: `REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE`, `REDMINE_MCP_JWT_SIGNING_KEY_FILE`, and `REDMINE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE`.

When `REDMINE_AUTOFILL_REQUIRED_CUSTOM_FIELDS=true`, `create_redmine_issue` retries once on relevant custom-field validation errors (for example `<Field Name> cannot be blank` or `<Field Name> is not included in the list`) and fills values only from:
- the Redmine custom field `default_value`, or
- `REDMINE_REQUIRED_CUSTOM_FIELD_DEFAULTS`

Example:

```bash
REDMINE_AUTOFILL_REQUIRED_CUSTOM_FIELDS=true
REDMINE_REQUIRED_CUSTOM_FIELD_DEFAULTS='{"Required Field A":"Value A","Required Field B":"Value B"}'
```

</details>

### SSL Certificate Configuration

Configure SSL certificate handling for Redmine servers with self-signed certificates or internal CA infrastructure.

<details>
<summary><strong>Self-Signed Certificates</strong></summary>

If your Redmine server uses a self-signed certificate or internal CA:

```bash
# In .env file
REDMINE_URL=https://redmine.company.com
REDMINE_API_KEY=your_api_key
REDMINE_SSL_CERT=/path/to/ca-certificate.crt
```

Supported certificate formats: `.pem`, `.crt`, `.cer`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Mutual TLS (Client Certificates)</strong></summary>

For environments requiring client certificate authentication:

```bash
# In .env file
REDMINE_URL=https://secure.redmine.com
REDMINE_API_KEY=your_api_key
REDMINE_SSL_CERT=/path/to/ca-bundle.pem
REDMINE_SSL_CLIENT_CERT=/path/to/cert.pem,/path/to/key.pem
```

**Note**: Private keys must be unencrypted (Python requests library requirement).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Disable SSL Verification (Development Only)</strong></summary>

⚠️ **WARNING**: Only use in development/testing environments!

```bash
# In .env file
REDMINE_SSL_VERIFY=false
```

Disabling SSL verification makes your connection vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

</details>

For SSL troubleshooting, see the [Troubleshooting Guide](./docs/troubleshooting.md#ssl-certificate-errors).

## Authentication

The server supports four authentication modes, selected via `REDMINE_AUTH_MODE`. It defaults to `legacy`, so existing deployments keep working with no changes; OAuth2 support is purely additive.

| Your situation | Mode | Redmine |
|---|---|---|
| Single shared credential, simplest setup | `legacy` (default) | any |
| Multi-user, you control the MCP client | `oauth` | 6.1+ |
| Hosted server, clients self-register (DCR) | `oauth-proxy` | 6.1+ |
| Multi-user, Redmine too old for OAuth | `legacy-per-user` | < 6.1 |

The advanced modes are collapsed below. For full setup, the [OAuth2 Setup Guide](./docs/oauth-setup.md) covers `oauth` and `oauth-proxy`, and the [legacy-per-user guide](./docs/legacy-per-user-auth.md) covers `legacy-per-user`.

### Legacy mode (default)

A single shared credential (API key or username/password) configured once in `.env`. Every request to Redmine uses the same identity.

```bash
REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=legacy        # or omit entirely; this is the default
REDMINE_URL=https://redmine.example.com
REDMINE_API_KEY=your_api_key
# OR:
# REDMINE_USERNAME=your_username
# REDMINE_PASSWORD=your_password
```

<details>
<summary><strong>OAuth2 mode</strong> (multi-user, Redmine 6.1+)</summary>

Each MCP request carries its own `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, so every user authenticates with their own Redmine account. The server validates each token against Doorkeeper's introspection endpoint before forwarding it, and exposes the OAuth2 discovery and `/revoke` endpoints clients need.

```bash
REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=oauth
REDMINE_URL=https://redmine.example.com
REDMINE_MCP_BASE_URL=https://redmine-mcp.example.com   # public URL of this server

# Confidential OAuth app registered in Redmine admin (see setup guide)
REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_ID=...
REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

You register the OAuth app manually in Redmine admin → **Applications** (no Dynamic Client Registration). Full walkthrough, endpoint reference, and troubleshooting: [OAuth2 Setup Guide](./docs/oauth-setup.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>OAuthProxy mode</strong> (hosted deployments with client self-registration)</summary>

FastMCP acts as the MCP-facing authorization server: it handles DCR for MCP clients, then redirects users to Redmine as the upstream OAuth provider for consent. Use this when clients (e.g. Claude Desktop, VS Code) expect to register themselves.

```bash
REDMINE_AUTH_MODE=oauth-proxy
REDMINE_URL=https://redmine.example.com
REDMINE_MCP_BASE_URL=https://redmine-mcp.example.com   # public URL of this server

# Confidential OAuth app registered in Redmine admin (see setup guide)
REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_ID=...
REDMINE_INTROSPECT_CLIENT_SECRET=...
REDMINE_MCP_JWT_SIGNING_KEY=...
```

The upstream Redmine app must register `${REDMINE_MCP_BASE_URL}/auth/callback` as its redirect URI. Storage, scaling, and credential-reuse notes are in the [OAuth2 Setup Guide](./docs/oauth-setup.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>legacy-per-user mode</strong> (Redmine older than 6.1)</summary>

For Redmine instances too old for OAuth, each user's MCP client sends its own Redmine API key in an `X-Redmine-API-Key` header. Each request runs as that user's identity with that user's permissions.

**This is an advanced, opt-in mode.** It requires TLS end-to-end and a correctly configured reverse proxy. Read [`docs/legacy-per-user-auth.md`](docs/legacy-per-user-auth.md) for the threat model, firewall guidance, and revocation runbook before enabling it.

**`mcp-remote` (recommended):**

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "redmine": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://your-host/mcp",
           "--header", "X-Redmine-API-Key:${RM_KEY}"],
  "env": { "RM_KEY": "<your redmine api key>" }
}}}
```

Note the colon with no surrounding spaces in `X-Redmine-API-Key:${RM_KEY}`. This avoids an arg-escaping bug in Cursor and Claude Desktop on Windows.

**VS Code (`mcp.json`):**

Use `.vscode/mcp.json` (workspace file) or the user profile `mcp.json`. The workspace `.mcp.json` silently drops `headers` (see microsoft/vscode#319528), so do not use that file. Pin VS Code 1.102 or newer.

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "redmine": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://your-host/mcp",
      "headers": { "X-Redmine-API-Key": "${input:rmKey}" },
      "inputs": [{ "id": "rmKey", "type": "promptString",
                   "description": "Redmine API key", "password": true }]
    }
  }
}
```

**Unsupported:** any client that cannot set a custom request header, or that reserves the `Authorization` header for its own OAuth flow.

</details>

## MCP Client Configuration

The server supports two transport modes:

| Mode | Command | Best for |
|------|---------|----------|
| **stdio** (recommended for local) | `redmine-mcp-server --stdio` | Claude Code, local development |
| **HTTP** | `redmine-mcp-server` | Remote, Docker, multi-client, network access |

The examples below show stdio mode for local clients (recommended) and HTTP mode for remote/shared deployments.

> For `legacy-per-user` mode, each client must also send an `X-Redmine-API-Key` header; see [legacy-per-user mode](#authentication) for header-aware configs.

<details>
<summary><strong>Visual Studio Code (Native MCP Support)</strong></summary>

VS Code has built-in MCP support via GitHub Copilot (requires VS Code 1.102+).

**Using CLI (Quickest):**
```bash
code --add-mcp '{"name":"redmine","type":"http","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp"}'
```

**Using Command Palette:**
1. Open Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Run `MCP: Open User Configuration` (for global) or `MCP: Open Workspace Folder Configuration` (for project-specific)
3. Add the configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "servers": {
       "redmine": {
         "type": "http",
         "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
4. Save the file. VS Code will automatically load the MCP server.

**Manual Configuration:**
Create `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace (or `mcp.json` in your user profile directory):
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "redmine": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Code</strong></summary>

**Recommended: stdio mode (local, no network needed)**
```bash
claude mcp add redmine -- redmine-mcp-server --stdio
```

Or configure manually in `~/.claude.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "redmine": {
      "command": "redmine-mcp-server",
      "args": ["--stdio"],
      "env": {
        "REDMINE_URL": "https://your-redmine-server.com",
        "REDMINE_API_KEY": "your_api_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Alternative: HTTP mode** (for remote/shared server)
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http redmine http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Desktop (macOS & Windows)</strong></summary>

Claude Desktop's config file supports stdio transport only. Use FastMCP's proxy via `uv` to bridge to this HTTP server.

**Setup:**
1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Click the **Claude** menu (macOS menu bar / Windows title bar) > **Settings...**
3. Click the **Developer** tab > **Edit Config**
4. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "redmine": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with", "fastmcp",
        "fastmcp",
        "run",
        "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

5. Save the file, then **fully quit and restart** Claude Desktop
6. Look for the tools icon in the input area to verify the connection

**Config file locations:**
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

**Note:** The Redmine MCP server must be running before starting Claude Desktop.

<summary><strong>Cursor</strong></summary>

Cursor talks to HTTP MCP servers directly, with no bridge.

1. Create `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (available in every project) or `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root (that project only):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "redmine": {
         "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
2. Save the file. Cursor picks the server up automatically; its MCP settings list the server and the tools it loaded.

**Note:** Cursor identifies a remote server by a bare `url` and has no `type` field, unlike the VS Code and Claude Code configs above.

**In `legacy-per-user` mode**, add the API key header:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "redmine": {
      "url": "https://your-host/mcp",
      "headers": { "X-Redmine-API-Key": "<your redmine api key>" }
    }
  }
}
```

**In `oauth` mode**, set `REDMINE_OAUTH_DISCOVERY_AS=self` on the MCP server. Cursor looks for authorization server metadata at its own canonical well-known location, which the default (`redmine`) discovery profile does not serve, so the flow stalls without it ([#188](https://github.com/jztan/redmine-mcp-server/issues/188)). See [Cursor and self-AS discovery](docs/oauth-setup.md#cursor-and-self-as-discovery).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Codex CLI</strong></summary>

Add to Codex CLI using the command:

```bash
codex mcp add redmine -- npx -y mcp-client-http http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp
```

Or configure manually in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.redmine]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "mcp-client-http", "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp"]
```

**Note:** Codex CLI primarily supports stdio-based MCP servers. The above uses `mcp-client-http` as a bridge for HTTP transport.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Kiro</strong></summary>

Kiro primarily supports stdio-based MCP servers. For HTTP servers, use an HTTP-to-stdio bridge:

1. Create or edit `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` in your workspace:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "redmine": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": [
           "-y",
           "mcp-client-http",
           "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp"
         ],
         "disabled": false
       }
     }
   }
   ```
2. Save the file and restart Kiro. The Redmine tools will appear in the MCP panel.

**Note:** Direct HTTP transport support in Kiro is limited. The above configuration uses `mcp-client-http` as a bridge to connect to HTTP MCP servers.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Generic MCP Clients</strong></summary>

Most MCP clients use a standard configuration format. For HTTP servers:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "redmine": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

For clients that require a command-based approach with HTTP bridge:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "redmine": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-client-http", "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

### Testing Your Setup

```bash
# Test connection by checking health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

## Supported Redmine Plugins

The server works against a stock Redmine instance. Six optional plugins add
more. To use one, install it on your Redmine server and set the matching env
var. Skipping a plugin costs you only that plugin's features.

| Plugin | Vendor | Env var | What it adds |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Agile](https://www.redmineup.com/pages/plugins/agile) | RedmineUP | `REDMINE_AGILE_ENABLED` | `get_redmine_issue` returns `story_points`, `agile_sprint_id`, `agile_position`; `update_redmine_issue` accepts `story_points` |
| [Checklists](https://www.redmineup.com/pages/plugins/checklists) | RedmineUP (Pro) | `REDMINE_CHECKLISTS_ENABLED` | 3 tools: `get_checklist`, `create_checklist_item`, `update_checklist_item` *(not built into this fork)* |
| [Products](https://www.redmineup.com/pages/plugins/products) | RedmineUP | `REDMINE_PRODUCTS_ENABLED` | 1 tool: `manage_product` *(not built into this fork)* |
| [CRM](https://www.redmineup.com/pages/plugins/crm) | RedmineUP | `REDMINE_CRM_ENABLED` | 1 tool: `manage_contact` *(not built into this fork)* |
| [DMSF](https://github.com/danmunn/redmine_dmsf) | danmunn (open source) | `REDMINE_DMSF_ENABLED` | 1 tool: `manage_document` *(not built into this fork)* |
| [Additional Tags](https://github.com/alphanodes/additional_tags) | AlphaNodes (open source) | `REDMINE_TAGS_ENABLED` | `get_redmine_issue` returns a `tags` array; `create_redmine_issue` / `update_redmine_issue` accept `tag_list` |

Agile and Additional Tags add fields to tools you already have, so they
register no new tools. The other four bring their own, which appear in
`tools/list` either way but return a feature-disabled error until you set the
flag. Tags also needs the `view_issue_tags`, `create_issue_tags`, and
`edit_issue_tags` permissions on the Redmine server.

## Conditional Required Fields

Stock Redmine's REST API exposes only the `is_required` flag on each custom field's *definition*; it cannot see required-ness imposed by workflow rules, role-based field permissions, or tracker/category-bound settings. If your issue model differs from stock — different trackers or categories require different fields — declare those rules in a JSON file so the server can discover and enforce them.

Create `required_fields.json` (schema in [`required_fields.example.json`](./required_fields.example.json); point elsewhere with `REDMINE_REQUIRED_FIELDS_FILE`):

```json
{
  "by_tracker": {
    "Bug": { "required": ["priority_id", "Department"], "defaults": { "Department": "Engineering" } }
  },
  "by_category": {
    "Hardware": { "required": ["cf_20"] }
  }
}
```

- `required` entries name standard fields by API key (`priority_id`, `subject`, ...) and custom fields by display name (`Department`).
- `defaults` auto-fill missing fields on `create_redmine_issue`.
- `get_required_fields` surfaces the rules to the LLM; `create_redmine_issue` rejects with a clear message (before touching Redmine) when a required field is still missing. This composes with the existing `REDMINE_AUTOFILL_REQUIRED_CUSTOM_FIELDS` fallback, which auto-fills from each custom field's `default_value` after Redmine reports a blank/invalid required field.

## Available Tools

This MCP server provides 42 tools for interacting with Redmine (plus 1 operator tool exposed by `REDMINE_MCP_EXPOSE_ADMIN_TOOLS=true`, for a maximum of 43). For full documentation of every tool, see the [Tool Reference](./docs/tool-reference.md).

**Core tools (42, always available):** Project Management (9), Issue Operations (13), Time Tracking (4), Discovery / Enumeration (8), Search & Wiki (2), File Operations (4), Gantt (1), Meta (1).

**Operator tools (1, admin-gated):** `cleanup_attachment_files`, registered only when `REDMINE_MCP_EXPOSE_ADMIN_TOOLS=true`.

### Operator tools (1, admin-gated)

Hidden from `tools/list` by default. Set `REDMINE_MCP_EXPOSE_ADMIN_TOOLS=true` to register them on the MCP surface. The underlying background tasks run regardless of this flag; exposing them only adds the option to drive them through MCP.

- [`cleanup_attachment_files`](docs/tool-reference.md#cleanup_attachment_files) - Manually trigger cleanup of expired attachment files (the background cleanup task runs automatically regardless)

## Blog posts

**The story behind the releases.** Building this server keeps surprising me: full API access that turned out to be a mistake, 69 tools that had to become 43, an OAuth scope bug that only surfaced when a contributor ran the flow against a real Redmine 6 instance. Plenty of the sharpest lessons arrived from other people's deployments rather than mine. I write about that thinking in [The Dispatch](https://blog.jztan.com/newsletter/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=redmine-mcp-server). Come along if that's your kind of thing.
